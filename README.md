# Michael Gough -> CarProgramOOP
## Object Oriented Personal Project
This program is software for a car program.
I am programming this as my personal project for Object Oriented Programming in my junior year at Florida Gulf Coast University.

## License 

This project is licensed under the MIT License.

## Getting Started

In order to get this project running, on your local computer for demonstration/testing, 
you must have Intellij (IDE) installed on your computer. 
Once you have that installed, you will get the link to this repository and pull it to your
intellij program to get it running.

## Built With

* IDE's Used:
    * Intellij

## Week 1  

Through the first two weeks of the car program, I created multiple interfaces, and added instance variables to them. 
In those interfaces, I also added methods, and getters and setters methods that correspond to the interface. 

## Week 2-4

In weeks 2-4, I have created a concrete class for VehicleChassis and VehicleFrame that implements one of the interface.  
I created a default constructor and overloaded constructor. In both constructors, I set the instance variables to a value. 
In these methods, I also used accessor and mutator methods to get and set the values of the instance variables. 
There's two strings in the methods that use the instance variables, and prints out a string. 
The main method is used to create test cases for our default and overloaded constructors. 

## Week 5-6

In weeks 5-6, I continued to build classes and make their constructor/methods that get overriden by 
other classes that we implement them from. I also continue to make toStrings and test cases in main methods within the classes. 

## Week 7-8

In weeks 7-8, I wrapped up the personal the personal project by completing the Vehicle and Car classes. I 
then passed the replit test.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

In this program, I utilized the concepts that I learned in Java, in my Object Oriented Programming class.
